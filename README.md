**📄 Brief Introduction:**
The Department & Discipline Management System is a desktop-based software solution designed to streamline the management of university academic departments, their disciplines, and user roles (such as Admins, Department Heads, and Students).
The system allows Admins to create and assign department heads, manage user roles, and oversee the structural organization of departments. Department Heads are empowered to manage the disciplines under their assigned departments. Students can view their personal profiles along with the relevant academic information, such as their assigned department and discipline.
By offering role-based access and modular functionality, the system enhances administrative efficiency, reduces manual paperwork, and improves transparency across academic entities.
The main goal of the system is to ensure that users at different levels of access can seamlessly perform their responsibilities within the academic hierarchy. It reduces administrative overhead, minimizes human error, ensures role-based data privacy, and promotes centralized, structured control over academic entities.

**🔍 Purpose of the System:**
In many educational institutions, maintaining updated records of departments, disciplines (specializations or degree programs), and user data (students and faculty) is done manually or through disconnected systems. This leads to issues such as data duplication, inefficiency in management, limited access control, and lack of accountability.

This system is designed to address these challenges by allowing:
•	Admins to create department heads, assign them departments, and manage users.
•	Department Heads to manage the disciplines offered under their departments.
•	Students to access their academic information such as their department and discipline, while maintaining a secure and simple interface.

**👨‍💻 Key Features:**
•	Secure login system with role-based access
•	Admin panel to manage users and departments
•	Discipline management by Department Heads
•	Student profile access with academic details
•	Scalable structure with clean module separation

The scope includes core modules such as user management, department and discipline assignment, and profile viewing, with potential for future integration of modules like course registration, grades, and attendance tracking.
This system supports three distinct user roles:
1.	Administrator – with privileges to create users, assign roles, and manage departments.
2.	Department Head – authorized to manage disciplines under their respective departments.
3.	Student – allowed to access personal academic records including department and discipline details.
Each user role is granted access to system features relevant to their responsibilities, ensuring both data privacy and accountability.
