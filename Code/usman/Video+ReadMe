Sure! Here's your cleaned-up and revised GitHub README **without the project structure section**:
# 📚 Department & User Management System – Java Swing MVC

A desktop-based application developed in Java using the **Swing GUI toolkit** and **MVC architecture**, designed to streamline department and user management in a university or institutional setting. This project was developed as part of a semester coursework and aims to demonstrate clean code principles, modular structure, and user-friendly design.

The system allows administrators to manage departments, assign roles such as *HOD*, and maintain user records (students, staff, and admins) with basic persistence. Ideal for learning **Java Swing**, **MVC pattern**, and **service-layer integration** with local storage.
